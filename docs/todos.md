# TODOs
1. Preserve the neighbour and repulsion ranges when swapping games
2. Allow stepping through of the cells manually
3. State saving/loading
    a. Allow cell positions to be converted into particle positions
    b. When creating scenarios always create them in the cells!
    c. Don't worry about converting particle positions into cell positions, only focus on the cell -> particle direction
