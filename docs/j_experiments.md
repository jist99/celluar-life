## "The Snake"
*snake.grid*
- Very similar behaviour observed between both games
- The snake in the cellular game moves much faster than the particle snake
- The shape the snakes form are similar also
- The cellular snake oscillates while it moves, the particle one is smooth
- The cellular snake can be destroyed by some well placed cells. The particles are more resilient
