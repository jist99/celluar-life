# Experiment Ideas

## Cellular stability
Apply a small pertubation to both particles and cells in a stable structure
are the cells as resistant as the particles

## Particle -> cellular structures (bad name?)
Do structures which show interesting behaviour in the particle game show the same
behaviour in the cellular game?

## Cellular -> particle structures
Do structures which show interesting behaviour in the cellular game show the same
behaviour as in the particle game?

## Extreme behaviour
Do the two games show similar behaviour when the settings are brought to extreme numbers?
At what point do two structures that look similar diverge with extreme settings?
